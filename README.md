The aim of this project is to enable an ordering, order pick-up and delivery system in the canteens of hostels of IIT Roorkee. This could give a major boost to the business of canteens and make life simple and efficient for the students by facilitating them with the option to pre-order before visiting the canteen and also with the option of delivery, if feasible.
